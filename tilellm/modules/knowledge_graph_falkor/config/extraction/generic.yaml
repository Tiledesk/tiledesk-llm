# Extraction prompt (inline)
extraction_prompt: |
  -Goal-
  Given a text document, identify all relevant entities and their relationships with SPECIFIC relationship types. Pay attention to temporal information (dates, timeframes) and organizational structures.

  -Steps-
  1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract:
  - entity_name: Name/identifier of the entity, capitalized, in language of 'Text'
  - entity_type: One of: [{entity_types}]
    * Entity type guide:
      - "PERSON": Individuals, professionals, historical figures
      - "ORGANIZATION": Companies, institutions, agencies, groups
      - "LOCATION": Cities, countries, regions, addresses, venues
      - "DOCUMENT": Reports, articles, books, papers, contracts
      - "CONCEPT": Ideas, theories, methodologies, frameworks
      - "TECHNOLOGY": Software, hardware, platforms, tools, systems
      - "PRODUCT": Goods, merchandise, offerings
      - "SERVICE": Services, programs, initiatives
      - "EVENT": Meetings, conferences, projects, incidents, milestones
      - "DATE": Specific dates, years, periods
      - "CATEGORY": Classifications, types, genres
      - "METRIC": KPIs, measurements, statistics
  - entity_description: Comprehensive description including attributes, context, and significance in language of 'Text'
  Format: ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

  2. Identify relationships between entities with SPECIFIC relationship types:
  - Use appropriate relationship types from this list:
    * WORKS_FOR, EMPLOYED_BY: employment relationships
    * MANAGES, REPORTS_TO: organizational hierarchy
    * OWNS, CONTROLS: ownership and control
    * LOCATED_IN, BASED_IN: spatial relationships
    * HAPPENED_ON, OCCURRED_AT, DURING: temporal relationships
    * PARTICIPATED_IN, ATTENDED, ORGANIZED: event participation
    * CREATED_BY, AUTHORED_BY, DEVELOPED_BY: creation and authorship
    * MENTIONS, REFERENCES, CITES, DESCRIBES: content relationships
    * CONTAINS, PART_OF, MEMBER_OF: hierarchical relationships
    * USES, REQUIRES, PROVIDES: usage and dependencies
    * SIMILAR_TO, RELATED_TO: associations (use only when no specific type fits)

  3. Temporal Anchoring:
  - Include relationship dates when mentioned (format: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, or YYYY)
  - For events, always try to extract temporal information

  For each relationship extract ALL 7 fields (relationship_type is MANDATORY):
  - source_entity: name from step 1
  - target_entity: name from step 1
  - relationship_type: ONE of the types above (UPPERCASE, use underscores) - REQUIRED
  - relationship_description: explanation with context in language of 'Text'
  - relationship_strength: numeric score (1-10) reflecting evidence strength
  - relationship_date: date/timestamp if mentioned (format: YYYY-MM-DD or "YYYY" or "unknown")

  CRITICAL: Every relationship MUST have exactly 7 fields. The 4th field MUST be a relationship_type from the list above.
  Format: ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_date>

  4. Return output as single list of entities and relationships using **{record_delimiter}** as delimiter.

  5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
